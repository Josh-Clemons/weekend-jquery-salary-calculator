Josh's Salary Calculator

## Description



Description:
Create a table that displays first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary. Use input fields to gather the information for each employee. A submit button will add it to the "Employees" table.

The table will display with a header, footer, and the body will update when new employees are added or deleted. A delete button will generate for each employee when they are added. 

A total monthly salary amount will display at the bottom of the page. If the number is greater than $20,000 the background color will change to red.
