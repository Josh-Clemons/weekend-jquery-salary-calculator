## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

Description:
Create a table that displays first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary. Use input fields to generate the information. 
Once an employee's input fields are completed a submit button will add the information to the table.
The table will display with a header, then update when new employees are added or deleted.
A total monthly salary amount will display at the bottom of the page. If that number is greater than $20,000 change the background of the element to red.
